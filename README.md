**Introduction and Purpose of Website:**  

This is a website was created by Emmanuel Takyi Obodai a student of the University of Ghana, on behalf of the Computer Science Department in the University.

Each page is dedicated to various aspect of the department.
These aspects include: Home, About Us, Admission, Academics, Contact Us, Events, Media and others.
This Interim Assessment was created with the intent of enabling us apply all the understanding we have gathered in HTML, CSS, and if applicable Javascript and React.

The website is made simple clear text. The only user-friendly language available is English.
The website was entirely made with HTML and CSS only.
It seeks to simplify the reachability to the department and its services without necessarily having to go to the department.


**How To Clone and Setup the Project:**
1. Fork the repository:

   A public repository is created, we must fork the repository to our own GITHUB account to begin working on the project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine

3. Use the right git command to add files, commit, and push those files to your remote repository after every significant change in the project.

To add all untracked or modifying files, the command git add -A is used, to commit the command git commit -m is used and finally to push to github the command git push -u is used
If the files to be committed have no significant change like untracked files and just need to be modified the command commit -a -m is used.

**What i have learnt from this project:**  
I have learn quite a lot.
Without a basic understanding a how to use HTML and CSS to build a website you would not be able to do the assignment.
Due to this i had to master most of the techniques used to create and organize divs and other basic features in web development with CSS and HTML.
